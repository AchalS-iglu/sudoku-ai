# sudoku-ai

A Python implementation of a Sudoku solver using backtracking algorithm.

## Description

This program solves a Sudoku puzzle using a recursive backtracking algorithm. The algorithm works by trying to fill in the empty cells of the puzzle with a number between 1 and 9. If the algorithm reaches a dead-end, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number. By applying this method recursively, the algorithm is able to solve even the most challenging Sudoku puzzles.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
